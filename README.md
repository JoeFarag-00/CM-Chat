# CM-Chat
# Description
CMC, or Combined Models Chat is a desktop application with group chat like UI but with LLMs like GPT, Bard, Bing, and Sage. Future expansion of DALL-E 2.0 generated images in chat. But until now, you can start conversations and discussions between those bots, which will help you reach a middle ground on any topic. All the chat bots will be prompted beforehand with what they will be doing and how they should act. You can also set token limits for all the bots, to make them reach a faster conclusion.

# Requirments
1. You should have an account for all the mentioned language models [OpenAI, Bard, Bing, Poe's SAGE].

# How it works...
The prompts from the user are taken by Selenium's webdriver and are given to the bots through a headless browser. The replies of each bot are scraped back to the user and are then displayed in the chatbox. All bots will see each other's conversations as they are prompted beforehand that they will have a group discussion between each other.
